# Hailstone Example
# A Hailstone sequence is a sequence produces by the following
# script, given a positive integer input.  Most mathematicians 
# believe that the Hailstone sequence eventually reaches 1 for 
# all initial values n, although they have not been able prove this.

n = int(input("Enter the initial value for the Hailstone sequence: "))

while n != 1:
    print(f"{n} ", end="")
    if n % 2 == 0:
        n = n // 2
    else:
        n = 3 * n + 1
