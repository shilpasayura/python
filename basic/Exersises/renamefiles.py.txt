# RenameFiles1 Example
# Rename files based on a list of original and new file names.
# In the same folder that contains the script renamefiles.py, 
# create a folder named originals; in this originals folder
# copy these four files: one.txt, two.txt, three.txt, and 
# four.txt. 

import os

for pair in filenames:
    fields = pair.split(",")
    original_name = fields[0].strip( ) + ".txt"
    new_name = fields[1].strip( ) + ".txt"
    print("Renaming", original_name, \
        "as", new_name + ".")
