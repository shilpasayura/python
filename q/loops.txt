things = str([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
for thing in things:
    print(thing)
This code is supposed to print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Fix it without changing the before list.

This program is supposed to convert everything in a list to integers and then calculate their sum. It should print 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 is 6. Fix the program.

input = ['1', '2', '3']

for string in input:
    numbers = []
    numbers.append(int(string))

result = 0
for n in numbers:
    result + n
print("their sum is", result)
This program is supposed to print [1, 2, 3]. Fix it.

numbers = ['1', '2', '3']
